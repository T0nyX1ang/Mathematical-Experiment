# Mathematical Experiment Dev Space

Welcome to the Mathematical Experiment Space for developers. 

You can find out our codes, documents and other things here, we suppose.

Before you start, please read the [important notices](#important-notices) below. When you finish, you may want to see our official page [here](https://t0nyx1ang.github.io/Mathematical-Experiment).

## Important Notices:
* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use our codes without permission. We can check code plagarism if we want to.
* You can still refer to our codes and make necessary changes, but **at your own risk**.
* You are strictly **NOT ALLOWED** to **copy or publish** our documents **anywhere**. Maybe they're sort of naive from your perspectives, please respect our work and devotion.
* You **can't access** our documents unless we have submitted them to our teacher.
* Although we have a strict distribution rule, it's **free of charge** to download our codes and documents for *academic* use.
