# Mathematical Experiment Space

Welcome to the Mathematical Experiment Space. 

You can find out our codes, documents and other things here, we suppose.

Before you start, please read the [important notices](./README.md#important-notices) below.

## Writing Template(LaTeX)
Writing template(.cls) file can be fetched [here](./raw/master/template/mathexpthesis.cls).

The main project is now maintained [here](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/WHU-MathExpThesis). The template holds a different license which is looser on distribution.(lppl-1.3c)

## Experiment Results
You can find our codes to complete the project in this place. However, those codes might be **modified** at any time.

You can also find out the results we get from our codes. However, some of the codes won't generate the **full** results as there are *dynamic* results, like a movie.

Those codes will be released **before** we submit the document which is mentioned in the following part.

Here is a table of our results:
* [Experiment 1 Results](./exp1/experiment1.html)

## Experiment Documents
You can find our documents submitted as our homework in PDF format. Mistakes, or even misunderstandings of a theory are probable as we just study about it.

Those codes will be released **after** we submit the document to our teacher.(Earlier than every Friday)

Here is a table of our documents:
* [Experiment 0 Document](./raw/master/exp0/exp0.pdf)

## Important Notices:
* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use our codes without permission. We can check code plagarism if we want to.
* You can still refer to our codes and make necessary changes, but **at your own risk**.
* You are strictly **NOT ALLOWED** to **copy or publish** our documents **anywhere**. Maybe they're sort of naive from your perspectives, please respect our work and devotion.
* You **can't access** our documents unless we have submitted them to our teacher.
* Although we have a strict distribution rule, it's **free of charge** to download our codes and documents for *academic* use.
