# Mathematical Experiment Space

Welcome to the Mathematical Experiment Space. 

You can find out our codes, documents and other things here, we suppose.

Before you start, please read the [licenses](./LICENSE.html). 

When you finish, you may want to see:

* [Our experiment results](#experiment-results)
* [Our experiment documents](#experiment-documents)
* [Our experiment revisions](#experiment-revisions)
* [Our dedicate LaTeX template](#writing-template)

## Experiment Results
You can find our codes to complete the project in this place. However, those codes might be **modified** at any time.

You can also find out the results we get from our codes. However, some of the codes won't generate the **full** results as there are *dynamic* results, like a movie.

Here is a table of our results:

* [Experiment 0 Results](./exp0/experiment0.html)
* [Experiment 1 Results](./exp1/experiment1.html)
* [Experiment 2 Results](./exp2/experiment2.html)
* [Experiment 3 Results](./exp3/experiment3.html)
* [Experiment 4 Results](./exp4/experiment4.html)
* [Experiment 5 Results](./exp5/experiment5.html)
* [Experiment 6 Results](./exp6/experiment6.html)
* [Experiment 7 Results](./exp7/experiment7.html)
* [Experiment 8 Results](./exp8/experiment8.html)
* [Experiment 9 Results](./exp9/experiment9.html)

## Experiment Documents
You can find our documents submitted as our homework in PDF format. Mistakes, or even misunderstandings of a theory are probable as we just study about it.

Here is a table of our documents:

* [Experiment 0 Document](./exp0/exp0.pdf)
* [Experiment 1 Document](./exp1/exp1.pdf)
* [Experiment 2 Document](./exp2/exp2.pdf)
* [Experiment 3 Document](./exp3/exp3.pdf)
* [Experiment 4 Document](./exp4/exp4.pdf)
* [Experiment 5 Document](./exp5/exp5.pdf)
* [Experiment 6 Document](./exp6/exp6.pdf)
* [Experiment 7 Document](./exp7/exp7.pdf)
* [Experiment 8 Document](./exp8/exp8.pdf)
* [Experiment 9 Document](./exp9/exp9.pdf)

## Experiment Revisions
Answers to papers and revisions are included here. We won't provide papers due to possible copyright issues, and answers are only references.

Here is a table of our revisions:

* [Revision](./revision/revision.pdf)
* [2018 Answer](./revision/2018Answer.pdf)
* [2017 Answer](./revision/2017Answer.pdf)

## Writing Template
Our LaTeX writing template is now maintained [here](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/WHU-MathExpThesis). The template holds a different license which is looser on distribution.[`lppl-1.3c`]

## Acknowledgements:

* Thanks my group for supporting this project.
* `jekyll`(base model) and `cayman`(base theme) greatly increased our efficiency in building the page.
* `MathJaX` for displaying LaTeX-style math formulas.

## Share Link:
Overleaf is a very good platform to compile LaTeX and it supports collaborative writing. In fact, we just compile our LaTeX documents at Overleaf. Click this [link](https://www.overleaf.com?r=de041c52&rm=d&rs=b) to use it, and we will get bonus if you register through this link.
